# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation was to create a site that hosted my body of work to show potential employers my skillsets from various projects. It solves the problem of me not having a tangible showcase for my work. I learned that my current CSS skills are not up to my own standards and that I need to spend a significant amount of more time and resources to gain further understanding and comprehension about the topic.
